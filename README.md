# HBML Website

## How to edit

* Pull website from github repo
* In terminal change into repository’s directory
* Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and terminal will print url such as http://127.0.0.1:4000/. Copy and paste url into browser
    * If you didn't install `jekyll` and `bundle` do so following the steps in these videos https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfP7Y9Ja6Qc https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhrU9m82Wm8&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB&index=2
* Make changes to website primarily using files in “_data” and “_pages”
* To see changes on website save the ammended page/data and refresh. Or close the window, cancel the localhost running in terminal (usually ctrl+c) and run `jekyll serve` in terminal (`bundle exec jekyll serve` just needs to be run once and then shortened version can be run after)
